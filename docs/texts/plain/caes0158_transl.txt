Farewell my dear children Farewell Priskos Nemonianos fifteen years old May Osiris give the cold water to you and to your sister who was carried off in the same hour with you And you Isidora seven years old farewell May Osiris give the cold water to you and to your brother who was carried off in the same hour with you May the earth be light for you and may those things she grants you below be good
