By Eudocia Augusta  In my life many and infinite wonders I have seen  But who however many his mouths could proclaim O noble clibanus  Your strength having been born a worthless mortal But rather  Is it just that you be called a new fiery ocean  Paean and life source provider of sweet streams  From you is born the infinite swell here one there another  On this side boiling but there in turn cold and tepid  You pour forth your beauty into four tetrads of springs  Indian and Matrona Repentius Elijah the Holy Antoninus the Good dewy Galatea and  Hygeia herself the large lukewarm pool and the small lukewarm pool  The Pearl the old clibanus Indian and also another Matrona Briara and the Nun and the spring of the Patriarch  For those in pain your mighty strength is ever constant
