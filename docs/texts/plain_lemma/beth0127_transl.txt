i the son of leontios lie dead justus the son of sappho who having plucked the fruit of all wisdom left the light my poor parents in endless mourning and my brothers too alas in my beth shearim and having gone to hades i justus lie here with many of my own kindred since might fate so willed be of good courage justus no one is immortal
