O Spirit the smoke of the henna! O Aattars! Let it be known that here is our steadfastness faithfulness The hamman with its wings is guarantor for it Make clear for Ta the god of Nashu the accomplishment of the vow with the profusion of closed flowers and sprouting And these are the disenchantresses Tinshar daughter of El Tipshar daughter of Tinshar Aasas son or daughter of Shamash Hargol daughter of El Shebatbata daughter of El - the female statuettes Release O Spirit release a man free him from the spell of a woman! You disenchantresses brought wood for a counter-charm So O Spirit explain to him the spark!
