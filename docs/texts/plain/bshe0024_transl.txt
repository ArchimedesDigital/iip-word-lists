Where the wreathed cross is there lies the lid of the mouth of the tomb which has rings Whoever wishes to bury shall lift the wreathed cross and he will find the lid and bury And if the Lady Mary who founded this church should desire in future to lay down a dead in this tomb she or anyone of her family at any time I Elias by the mercy of God a recluse in the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost curse and anathemize whoever after me hinders her or any of hers or removes this inscription of mine
